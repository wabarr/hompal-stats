## Problem 1

Use the data set of measurements of antelope astragali from [Barr (2014)](datasets/barr_astrag_2014.txt). 

A.  Read in the data, saving it to a variable called `astrag`.  Hint: be sure to specify the separator character in the data, which is a tab (represented in R as `\t`).
B.  Make a scatterplot with measurement `B` on the y-axis and `DistRad` on the x-axis.
