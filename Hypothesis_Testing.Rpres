Hypothesis Testing
========================================================


Induction versus Deduction
========================================================

***Induction*** is bottom up approach to reasoning, proceeding from specific observations to general explanations.  

***Deduction*** goes the other way: from general to specific. 

All methods of doing science use both inductive and deductive reasoning, but the emphasis that they receive differs. 

Deduction
========================================================

![hypotheticodeductive](hypothetico_deductive.png)

Deduction 
==============

*  Emphasis is on falsification
*  Requires multiple working hypotheses
*  In the end, there is (hopefully) only one that hasn't been falsified
*  Limitation: "correct" hypothesis MUST be among the alternatives studied


Induction
========================================================

![Induction](inductive.png)


Induction
========================================================


*  Emphasis is on confirmation
*  Builds and modifies hypothesis based on previous knowledge
*  Limitation: may "get off on wrong foot" if hypothesis is just plain wrong


Testing Hypotheses
================

Consider a [fake dataset of body mass and femoral head diameters](datasets/baboons.txt) from male and female baboons. 

<span class="mega-octicon octicon-puzzle"></span> Read this into R on your own, and make a boxplot like this, with the points overlaid on the boxes. 

***

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
baboons <- read.table("datasets/baboons.txt", header=TRUE)


qplot(x=SEX, y=FHD, data=baboons, main="Baboon FHD by Sex", geom="boxplot") + geom_point(color="red", size=3)
```
