# Categorical Data

```{r codeToCreateDataset, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE }
taxa <- c("Gazella", "Connochaetes","Tragelaphus", "Aepyceros")

dry <- rmultinom(4, 1000, prob=c(.4,.4,.2,.3))
colnames(dry) <- c("site1", "site2", "site3", "site4")
wet <- rmultinom(4, 1000, prob=c(.2, .3, .5, .6))
colnames(wet) <- c("site5", "site6", "site7", "site8")

sites <- cbind(dry, wet)


#scale numbers 
sites <- as.data.frame(apply(sites, MARGIN = 2, FUN=function(col){ceiling(col* runif(1, min=0.3, max=1))}))
sites$taxon <- taxa
library(tidyr)
sites <- gather(sites, key="site", value="count", site1:site8)
```

Using this [fake data of bovid occurrences](datasets/bovid_occurrences.txt), do the following:

## Problem 1

Reshape the data into a 4 X 8 contingency table with 4 rows representing taxa and 8 colums representing sites (not counting row or column headers).

## Problem 2

Make a beautiful faceted barplot showing bovid communities across the different sites.

## Problem 3

Perform the appropriate statistical analysis to test the hypothesis of a relationship between site and taxon.  In other words....are the taxon abundances different among the different sites? Explain your choice of analysis and your interpretation.
