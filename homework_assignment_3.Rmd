## Question #1

Using the built-in `iris` dataset:

a) write a for() loop to test whether each numeric column in the `iris` dataset is normally distributed using the `shapiro.test()` function, and print out the p-value from this test *you must write a for loop to get credit for this question*
b) make a histogram of each `iris` numeric variable
c) calculate the mean and median of the squared value of `iris$Sepal.Length` (calculated like this: `iris$Sepal.Length^2`).
d) explain in words why these mean and median values are different.

## Question #2

One very common problem in bio-statistics is that many characters are not quite normally distributed. To understand how that arises, try the following steps:

a) Generate a vector called `body.sizes` for 1000 individuals sampled from a normal distribution with mean = 10 grams and sd = 3 grams. Save a copy of this in a variable called `body.sizes.original` so we can always go back and look at the original. 

b) Simulate body growth assuming that each individual grows by some percentage each year ($t$) so that $size(t+1) = g*size(t)$. A reasonable value of $g$ might be 1.15 (15% growth per year). Write a loop representing 10 years of growth, in which you update the vector `body.sizes` by multiplying it by the annual growth rate each year for 10 years. Save the result to a new variable called `body.sizes.growth`.

c) Next, model inter-individual variation in growth rates. Create a vector of growth rates for the 1000 individuals, with mean 1.15 and standard deviation of 0.2. Reset `body.sizes` to its original values. Again simulate 10 years of growth this time applying each individual's specific growth rate. ***Note:*** an individual's growth rate stays the same from year to year, but each individual should have a different growth rate. Save the results to a new variable called `body.sizes.vargrowth`.

d) Finally, simulate stochastic fluctuations in environment reflecting the fact that different years have different environmental conditions. Reset `body.sizes` to its original values. Repeat the variable growth scenario, but each year multiply ALL individuals with a single scaling factor representing the productivity that particular year. Have that scaling factor be drawn from a normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation of 0.2. Save the results to `body.sizes.environmentalgrowth`.

e) Do a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality on all four distributions. Which ones are normal, which arenâ€™t? Produce Q-Q plots of all four. Verbally describe the deviations from normality.

f) To conclude, answer the following questions:

    1.  Does growth of a normally-distributed population lead to non-normal distributions?
    2.  Does variation in growth cause non-normality?
    3.  Does environmental stochasticity reduce or amplify body size variation?
