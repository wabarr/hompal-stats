## Submit a single R Markdown file (.Rmd) with your responses.

1. Organizing data
    * Download [this excel spreadsheet](datasets/bad_data_organization.xls)
    * This spreadsheet is not in a form that can be read into R.  Think about why not, keeping in mind [this information on data input](intro_to_R.html#data-input).
    * Re-organize the excel sheet to make it readable in R, save it as a text file (or .csv) then read in the data. Make sure that your the R markdown file you turn in prints out the dataframe.  
    * Describe in words at least two major things that were wrong (from the perspective of an R user) with the original organization of this data file.   

2. Manipulation
    * Read in the file http://hompal-stats.wabarr.com/datasets/gorilla_sizes.txt as a dataframe
    * add a new column called `sex` that that encodes the specimens sex. Hint: you can use the `grep()` function to determine the sex from the specimen number.
