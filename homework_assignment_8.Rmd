## Problem 1

A.  Load [Howell's craniometric dataset](http://hompal-stats.wabarr.com/datasets/Howell_craniometry.txt)
B.  Get rid of unwanted data. Select only the following columns: <span style="color:red;">ID, Sex, Population, BNL, MDH, EKB, ZOR, BAA, NBA</span>. Filter the dataset to only include individuals from the following populations: <span style="color:red;">BUSHMAN, PERU, NORSE, ZULU</span>.
C.  Calculate the variance / covariance matrix for the 6 numeric variables.

## Problem 2

A.  Compute a Euclidian distance matrix for the 6 numerical variables.  **Save this to a variable, DO NOT PRINT THIS TO THE SCREEN OR INCLUDE IT IN THE OUTPUT**
B.  Perform a hierarchical cluster analysis using the distance matrix you just computed. Use the `hclust()` function for this
C.  Use the `plot()` function to plot the cluster analysis dendrogram. 
D.  Interpret the plot visually. Which which single specimen (identified on the plot by its data-frame row number) is most distinct from all other specimens? 




## Problem 3

A.  Perform a Principal Components Analysis on the data...make sure to use `scale=TRUE` to scale your variables!
B.  Which single variable has the strongest loading on PC1?
C.  What is the cumulative proportion of variance explained by PC1 and PC2?
D.  Make a plot of the PC1 scores against PC2 scores. Color code the point based on the population variable.
