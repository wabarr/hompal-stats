Linear Mixed Models

## LMMs

Categorical Explanatory Variables
=====================

So far in [ANOVA](anova.html) we have treated all categorical vars as the same

There are actually two types of categorical variables

*  ***fixed effects***
*  ***random effects***

## It can be tricky to tell them apart

Fixed Effects
=============

Random Effects
=============


Two main circumstances where LMM is first choice
================

*  none of your effects are fixed (less common)
*  you have fixed effects, but have ***pseudoreplication***

Model Simplification
