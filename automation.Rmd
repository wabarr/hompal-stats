# Automation

R is a programming language, which means that it gives you all the tools you need to automate repetitive tasks.  There are three main ways to do this:

* `for` loops
* the `apply()` family of functions
* the `dplyr` package

## for loops

`for` loops will be familiar if you have ever used any other programming languages.  The basic structure looks like this:

```{r results='hide'}
myVector <- 1:100
for(counter in myVector){
  print(paste("counter ^ 2 = ", counter^2))
}
```

We loop over a vector `1:100`, and sequentially assign its values to a temporary variable `i`.  Then R does what is within the curly braces `{}` for each iteration of the loop.  In this case, it pastes together some text with the square of the value of `i` and prints this all to the console.

```{r}

```
