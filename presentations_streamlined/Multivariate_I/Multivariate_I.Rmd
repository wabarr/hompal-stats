## A brief note on presentations

<img src="../../images/pygmy_marmoset.jpg" height=400px>

Every time someone says "I know you can't read the axis labels", a pygmy marmoset is murdered.

## Multivariate Data {.build}

Often we collect many different variables

We want to answer questions like:

> *  how are the variables related?
> *  are their differences in the means and variances of the variables?
> *  can we look at a composite of some of these variables to simplify our data?

<p class="red2">These questions are the domain of multivariate statistics</p>

## Matrix Algebra 

The nuts and bolts of multivariate statistics

You need to know the basics (at least the terminology) in order to understand multivariate stats.

## A matrix {.build}

$$A = \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
a_{11} & a_{12} & .. & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & .. & a_{2n} \\
.. & .. & .. & ..\\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & .. & a_{mn} \end{array}\right]
$$ 

> *  Consists of $m$ rows and $n$ columns
> *  if $m=n$ then it is a **square matrix**
> *  each row is a **row vector**
> *  each column is a **column vector**
> *  a single number is called a **scalar**
> *  matrices are represented by capital letters

## Matrix Transposition 

Matrices can be transposed by swapping the rows and columns

$$A = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
c & d  \\
e & f \end{array}\right]
$$ 

becomes

$$A' = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
a & c & e\\
b & d & f  \end{array}\right]
$$ 

## Types of Matrices {.build}


**Zero matrix** $$0 = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right]
$$

**Diagonal matrix** $$D = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
d_1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & d_2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & d_3\end{array}\right]
$$

A **Symmetrical matrix** is a square matrix whose transpose is identical to the original.

## Types of Matrices 


**Diagonal matrix** $$D = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
d_1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & d_2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & d_3\end{array}\right]
$$

**Identity matrix** $$I = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right]
$$

## Operations on Matrices 


**Equality** - Two matrices are equal only if they have same size, and all elements are equal. 

**Trace** - The sum of the diagonal terms.

Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division all have their matrix counterparts. 

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors 


Consider a system of linear equations, where $\lambda$ is a scalar:

$$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + ... + a_{1n}x_n = \lambda x_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + ... + a_{2n}x_n = \lambda x_2\\
... \\
a_{n1}x_1 + a_{n2}x_2 + ... + a_{nn}x_n = \lambda x_n$$

We can write this in matrix form. 

$$Ax = \lambda x$$ or $$ (A - \lambda I)x = 0$$

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors 


These equations only hold true for some values of $\lambda$, which are called the **eigenvalues**.  

There are up to $n$ eigenvalues. 

These equations can be solved for a given eigenvalue (e.g., the $ith$), and the resulting set of values is called the $ith$ **eigenvector**.

The sum of the eigenvalues of matrix $A$ is equal to the trace of matrix $A$.

## Covariance Matrices 

Recall the **sample covariance** for two variables, calculated from the sum of cross-products 

$$\ s_{XY} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{(n-1)}$$

## Covariance Matrices {.build}


With a multivariate sample comprising $p$ variables, we can define a sample **covariance matrix**:

$$ S = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
s_{11} & s_{12} & .. & s_{1p}\\
s_{21}& s_{22} & .. & s_{2p} \\
.. & .. & .. & .. \\
s_{p1} & s_{p2} & .. &  s_{pp} \end{array}\right]$$

<p class="red2">What do the diagonal elements represent?</p>

## Covariance Matrices 

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x * 0.3 + rnorm(100, sd=0.4)
z <- rnorm(100)
myMatrix <- cbind(x,y,z)
var(myMatrix)
```

## Correlation Matrices 


Recall the **correlation coeffiecient** for two variables, which is a scaled version of the  covariance.

$$ correlation\ coeffiecient = \frac{cov\ XY}{(sd\ X \times sd\ Y)}$$

or more formally:

$$ r = \frac{s_{xy}}{(s_{X} \times s_{Y})}$$

## Correlation Matrices {.build}


We can then compute the correlation matrix for a multivariate sample of $p$ variables.

$$ R = \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & r_{12} & .. &  r_{1p}\\
r_{21}& 1 & .. & r_{2p} \\
.. & .. &  .. & .. \\
r_{p1} & r_{p2} &  .. & 1 \end{array}\right]$$

<p class="red2">Why are the diagonal elements all 1?</p>

## Correlation Matrices 

```{r}
head(myMatrix, 4)
cor(myMatrix)
```

## Multivariate Distance Metrics {.build}


With a single variable (e.g. femur length) it is easy to conceptualize how far apart two observations are.

> *  Femur A = 25cm
> *  Femur B = 30cm
> *  <span class="red2">How far apart are these individuals in terms of femoral length?</span>

As we add more measurements, it becomes less obvious to tell how "far apart" two specimens are.

If the Humerus of indivual A is 15cm and the Humerus of indiviaual B is 22cm, then how far apart are individuals A and B?

We need a multivariate distance metric.

## Euclidian Distance 

<img src="../../images/pythagoras.jpg" height=400px>

 
$$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 }$$

## Euclidian Distance {.columns-2}

<img src="../../images/distance.jpg" height=500px>

 

Assuming 2 variables, we can compute the distance as the hypotenuse of a triangle:

$$d_{ij} =\sqrt{(x_{i1} - x_{j1})^2 + (x_{i2} - x_{j2})^2}$$

## Euclidian Distance 

We can compute a Euclidian distance for any number of variables:

$$d_{ij} = \sum\limits_{k=1}^p \sqrt{ (x_{ik})^2 - (x_{jk})^2 }$$

## Euclidian Distance {.build}

Euclidian distances can easily be swamped by large scale measurements.

To avoid this, you can calculate a **z score** by subtracting the mean of the measurement and dividing by the standard deviation.

The `dist()` function in R calculates Euclidian distances by default.

## Mahalanobis Distance {.build}


Calculates the distance of an observation from its multivariate sample, taking into account the covariance of the variables.  

$$D^2_{ij} = \sum\limits_{r=1}^p \sum\limits_{s=1}^p (x_{r} - \mu_{r})\ v^{rs} (x_{s} - \mu_{s})$$

where $v^{rs}$ is the covariance between variables $r$ and $s$

## Mahalanobis Distance 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
set.seed(1234)
library(ggplot2)
x1 <- rnorm(5000, sd=5)
x2 <- x1 * 1.5 + rnorm(5000, sd=4)
means <- c(mean(x1), mean(x2))
myMatrix <- cbind(x1, x2)
VCV <- var(myMatrix)
mhdists <- mahalanobis(myMatrix, means, VCV)
qplot(x1,x2, color=mhdists, size=I(6)) + 
  theme_bw(20) + 
  scale_color_continuous(low = "blue", high="red")
```


## Mahalanobis Distance 

```{r}
means <- c(mean(x1), mean(x2))
myMatrix <- cbind(x1, x2)
VCV <- var(myMatrix)
```

```{r}
mhdists <- mahalanobis(myMatrix, means, VCV)
mhdists[1:4]
```

## Distance Matrices 

Several multivariate techiques derive directly from matrices of distances. 


## Calculate a Euclidian Distance Matrix

```{r}
var1 <- rnorm(5); var2 <- rnorm(5)
myMatrix <- cbind(var1,var2); head(myMatrix, 3)
dist(myMatrix)
```



## Cluster Analysis {.build}


start with a distance matrix

assume each individual is in a group of 1

join individuals within a given distance into a group

continue joining groups until there is a single group

visualize with a tree (dendrogram)




## Principal Components Analysis {.build}

Goal is to "summarize" variation in multivariate data

Reducing dimensionality of dataset is called *ordination* and many multivariate techniques fall in to this category

Reduce the number of dimensions needed to describe most of the variance

## PCA - Intuitively 

Start with some data points

<img src="../../images/PCA_schematics/0.jpg" width=900>

## PCA - Intuitively 

Examine the variance of the points along some axis...


<img src="../../images/PCA_schematics/1.jpg" width=900>

## PCA - Intuitively 


This axis covers much more variance in our points...

<img src="../../images/PCA_schematics/2.jpg" width=900>


## PCA - Intuitively 

Imagine these points in some XY coordinate system....


<img src="../../images/PCA_schematics/3.jpg" width=900>

## PCA - Intuitively 

We can still find the axis of maximum variation....

<img src="../../images/PCA_schematics/4.jpg" width=900>

## PCA - Intuitively 

Then we find the orthogonal axis, 90$^\circ$ from major axis

<img src="../../images/PCA_schematics/5.jpg" width=900>

## PCA - Intuitively 

Next, we rotate the data to use the two new principal components axes we found...

## PCA - operationally {.build}

> *  Starting with the covariance matrix
> *  The eigenvalues of this matrix are the variances explained by each PC
> *  The eigenvectors of this matrix are the contributions of each original variable to the PC
> *  The eigenvectors can be thought of as "transformation equations" to convert a datapoint from the original space to the PC space

## PCA - more details {.build}


> *  We start with $p$ variables for $n$ individuals
> *  The first PC is the linear combination of all the variables:
> *  $PC1 = a_1X_1 + a_2X_2 + ... + a_pX_p$
> *  PC1 is chosen to vary as much as possible for all the individuals, subject to the condition that the sum of the squared $a$ terms is 1
> *  Subsequent PCs are uncorrelated with the prior PCs

## PCA - even more details {.build}


> 1.  (sometimes) **scale** and **center** your variables to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1.
> 2.  Calculate the covariance matrix (this will be a correlation matrix if you did step 1)
> 3.  Find the eigenvalues (variances of the PCs) and corresponding eigenvectors (the loadings for each variable) for the covariance/correlation matrix
> 4.  Ignore the components that (hopefully) explain very little variance, and focus on the first few components

## Principal Components Analysis in R {.build}

There are 2 functions in R

> *  `prcomp()` 
> *  `princomp()`

These differ in their implementation and default arguments, but provide similar results. 

However, `prcomp()` is preferred for numerical accuracy

## PCA - Learn by Doing 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=10}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
theme_set(theme_bw(15))
sepal<-qplot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, data=iris, color=Species, main="Iris Sepal", size=I(6))
petal<-qplot(Petal.Length, Petal.Width, data=iris, color=Species, main="Iris Petal", size=I(6))
grid.arrange(sepal, petal, nrow=1)
```

<p class="red2">Do a PCA on the numeric colums of the iris dataset, and plot the first and second PC axes</p>


```{r include=FALSE}
irisPCA <- prcomp(iris[,1:4], 
                  scale=TRUE, center=TRUE)
irisPCA
summary(irisPCA)
```



```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=10, include=F}
qplot(irisPCA$x[,1], 
      irisPCA$x[,2], 
      xlab="PC1", ylab="PC2", main="Iris PCA", color=iris$Species, size=I(6))
```
