## Problem 1

Recreate this figure using the tools in `ggplot2`. The data come from the [Zachos et al 2001 deep sea oxygen isotope dataset](datasets/Zachos2001Climate.txt). Plot the o18 values against time, and include rectangular overlays that show the geological epochs of the Cenezoic.  

![zachos][1]

Use these approximate start dates for the geological epochs: 

    epoch = c("Paleocene", "Eocene", "Oligocene", "Miocene", "Pliocene", "Pleistocene", "Holocene")
    start = c(65, 58.8, 33.9, 23.03, 5.5, 1.8, 0.01)
    
Note: The original dataset is noisy.  Use a convolution filter with the `filter()` function to reduce noise in the dataset.

Note also: You can use `scale_x_reverse()` to flip an axis.

Note one more thing: This is a good example of a case in which you need separate dataframes for separate layers.
