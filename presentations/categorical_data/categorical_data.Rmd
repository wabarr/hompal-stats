## Categorical Data 

Data that falls into a discrete number of categories. 

The different possible values of a categorical variable are called **levels**

```{r}
bird_sightings <- 
  factor(c("pigeon", "pigeon", "goshawk", 
           "eagle", "goshawk"))
levels(bird_sightings)
```

## Example - Species Occurrences 


```{r}
myData <- data.frame(
  site = sample(c("forest1","meadow2"), 1000, replace=T),
  species = sample(c("Homo_sapiens","Bison_bison", "Canis_latrans"),1000, replace=T)
  )
head(myData)
```

## Example - Species Occurrences 


R has useful tools for counting occurrences

```{r}
table(myData$site,myData$species)
```

This is called a **contingency table**. Analysis of categorical data always operates on contingency tables.

## Contingency Tables {.build}


A more real (but still fake) example.

Site | *A. afarensis* | *Ar. ramidus* |  *Aepyceros melampus*
---|----|-----|-------
Hadar | 120 | 0 | 600
Aramis | 0 | 90 | 220

Made up of counts or **frequencies** of observations in each category.

Rows are indexed by $i$ and columns are indexed by $j$.

There are $n$ rows in a table and $m$ columns.

Analyzing contingency tables requires the raw counts: not percentages, proportions, etc.

## Hypothesis Testing {.build}

  
Site | *A. afarensis* | *Ar. ramidus* |  *Aepyceros melampus*
---|----|-----|-------
Hadar | 120 | 0 | 600
Aramis | 0 | 90 | 220


**Null hypothesis**: no association between $site$ variable and the $species$ variable.

**Alternative hypothesis**: There is a relationship between the $site$ variable and the $species$ variable

To reject the null hypothesis, we need to ask, what are the **expected values** of the cells, assuming no association?

## Hypothesis Testing - Expected Values {.build}

Site | *A. afarensis* | *Ar. ramidus* |  *Aepyceros melampus* 
---|----|-----|-------
Hadar | 120 | 0 | 600
Aramis | 0 | 90 | 220

<p class="red2">Intuitively, what would you expect the value of each cell to be assuming the row and column variable are unrelated???</p>

## Hypothesis Testing - Expected Values {.build}

Going back to probability, the probability of being an *A. afarensis* at Hadar is a **shared event** made up of two **simple events**:

> *  being *A. afarensis*
> *  being at Hadar

We simply multiply these probabilities and multiply by the sample size

## Hypothesis Testing - Expected Values {.build}

>  - Probablility of being *A. afarensis*
>        - $120 / 1030 = 0.1165$
>  - Probablility of occuring at Hadar
>        - $720 / 1030 = 0.6990$
>  - Probablility of being *A. afarensis* at Hadar
>        - $0.6990 * 0.1165 = 0.0814$

Expected value of this cell is $0.0814 * 1030 = 83.84$

## Hypothesis Testing - Expected Values 

Shortcut for computing expected cell frequencies:

$$\hat{Y}_{i,j} = \frac{row\ total\times{column\ total}}{sample\ size} = \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^mY_{i,j}\times\sum\limits_{i=1}^nY_{i,j}}{N}$$

<p class="red2">**Volunteer:** calculate by hand on board!</p>

Site | *A. afarensis* | *Ar. ramidus* |  *Aepyceros melampus* 
---|----|-----|-------
Hadar | 120 | 0 | 600
Aramis | 0 | 90 | 220 

## Hypothesis Testing - Chi-Square 


Karl Pearson came up with a test statistic to quantify how much the observed counts differ from the expected values:

$$X^2_{Pearson} = \sum\limits_{all\ cells}\frac{(Observed-Expected)^2}{Expected}$$

<p class="red2">This is analogous to the residual sum of squares in linear modeling.</p>

## Hypothesis Testing - Chi-Square {.columns-2}


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=4}
library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(y=dchisq(seq(1,25,by=0.1), df = 5), x=rep(1,241))
qplot(x=1:241, y=y, data=df, geom="line") + 
  theme_bw(15) + 
  labs(x="", y="density", title="Chi-square with 5 df")
```


Chi-square has a known parametric distribution

Can be used to calculate p-values

## Chi-square in R 


```{r}
myTable <- table(myData$site,myData$species)
chisq.test(myTable)
```

<p class="red2">Note that this function expects a contingency table, not two vectors</p>
## Fisher's Exact Test 


More appropriate when sample sizes are low.

General rule is to use Fisher's if expected value for any cell is < 5.

```{r}
fisher.test(myTable)
```

## Goodness of Fit Tests 


These test how closely observed data fit some underlying distribution (e.g., binomial, uniform, normal)

For discrete cases, chi-square can be used as a goodness of fit statistic.  

## Chi-square goodness of fit 


For instance:  say we counted the frequency of a *A. afarensis* in 4 different geological strata through time. 

```{r}
afarensis <- c(24, 32, 19, 36)
```


## Chi-square goodness of fit 


We can use chi-square to test how well this fits a uniform distribution:

```{r}
chisq.test(afarensis)
```

## Chi-square goodness of fit 


We could specify some other distribution by passing a vector of probabilities.

```{r}
chisq.test(afarensis, p=c(.4, .1, .1, .4))
```

## Continuous Goodness of Fit - KS 


The **Kolmogorov-Smirnov** is a commonly used goodness of fit test for continuous data.

The KS test compares the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a set of observed data to a theoretical distribution.

## KS-Test 


```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- rnorm(1000)
y <- x * 0.3 + rnorm(1000, sd=0.1)
resids <- resid(lm(y^2~x))
plot(ecdf(resids), main="Empirical CDF")

#trying to figure out how to get it on the same plot
#xrange <- seq(from = min(resids), to=max(resids), length.out = 100)
#densities <- pnorm(q = xrange , sd = sd(resids))
#points(x=xrange, y=densities)
```

-------------

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(ecdf(rnorm(1000, sd=sd(resids))), main="Theoretical EDF")
```

## KS-Test 

The single largest deviation of the empirical from the theoretical is the KS statistic. This is used to compute a p-value.

Can be used for any distribution, not just the normal distribution.

## KS-Test in R 

```{r}
ks.test(rnorm(100), "pnorm")

```

## KS-Test in R 

```{r}
ks.test(rnorm(100)^2, "pnorm")
```

## Challenge

Read in this dataset on political party affiliation and gender in the USA. http://hompal-stats.wabarr.com/datasets/party_affiliation.txt

Make a plot to visualize the data that looks like the following

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
gendergap <- read.delim("http://hompal-stats.wabarr.com/datasets/party_affiliation.txt", sep=",")
gendergap$party <- factor(gendergap$party, ordered=T, levels=c("Republican", "Independent", "Democrat"))
ggplot(data=gendergap, aes(x=gender, fill=party)) + geom_bar(position="dodge") + theme_bw(20)
```

## Challenge

Use chi-square to test the hypothesis that there is a gendered difference in party affiliation.

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
test <- chisq.test(table(gendergap))
test$residuals
```


## Challenge

Check out the built-in dataset `trees`.

Are the tree heights drawn from a normal distribution?  Test this hypothesis using the appropriate goodness of fit test.
