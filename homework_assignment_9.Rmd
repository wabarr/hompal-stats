## Problem 1

A.  load [this dataset](datasets/DIK-scap.txt) on scapula morphology in Pan, Homo and Gorilla, and the Dikika fossil child.  Details on this data can be found in [Alemseged et al, 2006](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7109/full/nature05047.html)
B.  Calculate the natural log of all the numeric variables
C.  Perform a discriminant function analysis (DFA) on the data. 
D.  Which variable has the strongest positive contribution to LD1?  Which variable has the strongest negative contribution to LD1?
E.  Make a beautiful plot (using ggplot) of LD1 versus LD2. Hint: to get the LD scores, use the `predict()` function on your discriminant function analysis model object.  This will give you access to the LD scores stored the `x` slot.
F. 
G. BONUS POINT: Surround the points corresponding to each taxon with a polygon to ease visualization. *Hint:* the `chull()` function can be used to compute convex hulls, which is the name for polygons that enclose groups of points.
