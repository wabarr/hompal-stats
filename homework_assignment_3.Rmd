## Question #1

Using the built-in `iris` dataset:

a) use the `lapply()` function to test each numeric column for normality using the `shapiro.test()` function...saving the results to a list called `iris_results`. 
b) Use the `lapply()` function again to loop over `iris_results` and extract the p values.  
c) make a histogram of each `iris` numeric variable, and annotate the plot with the corresponding p value.
d) calculate the mean and median of `iris$Sepal.Length^2`
e) explain in words why these mean and median values are different.

## Question #2

One very common problem in bio-statistics is that many characters are not quite normally distributed. To understand how that arises, try the following steps:

a) Generate a vector called `body.sizes` for 1000 individuals sampled from a normal distribution with mean = 10 grams and sd = 3 grams. Save a copy of this in a variable called `body.sizes.original` so we can always go back and look at the original. 

b) Simulate body growth assuming that each individual grows by some percentage each year ($t$) so that $size(t+1) = g*size(t)$. A reasonable value of $g$ might be 1.15 (15% growth per year). Write a loop representing 10 years of growth, in which you update the vector `body.sizes` by multiplying it by the annual growth rate each year for 10 years. Save the result to a new variable called `body.sizes.growth`.

c) Next, model variable growth rates for each individual. Create a vector of growth rates for the 1000 individuals, with mean 1.15 and standard deviation of 0.2. Reset `body.sizes` to its original values. Again simulate 10 years of growth but with varying growth rates for each individual. Save the results to a new variable called `body.sizes.vargrowth`.

d) Finally, simulate stochastic fluctuations in environment reflecting the fact that different years have different environmental conditions. Reset `body.sizes` to its original values. Repeat the variable growth scenario, but each year multiply ALL individuals with a scaling factor representing the productivity that particular year. Have that scaling factor be drawn from a normal distribution with mean 1 and variance 0.2. Save the results to `body.sizes.environmentalgrowth`.

e) Test all four distributions for normality. Which ones are normal, which arenâ€™t? Produce Q-Q plots of all four. Verbally describe the deviations from normality.

f) To conclude, answer the following questions:

    1.  Does growth of a normally-distributed population lead to non-normal distributions?
    2.  Does variation in growth cause non-normality?
    3.  Does environmental stochasticity reduce or amplify body size variation?
