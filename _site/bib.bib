	abstract = {Tropical savannas are commonly described as biomes with continuous grass strata and discontinuous tree or shrub strata. A number of simple models have been developed that allow tropical savannas to be compared to one another. Older models were based on two or three variables such as rainfall, temperature, and soil texture, but newer ones either include a greater number of environmental variables or utilize biologically relevant factors such as the moisture and nutrients available to plants during their growing season. In this paper, the effectiveness of these models in describing the structure and function of the savannas of East Africa is examined.},
