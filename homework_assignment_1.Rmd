## Submit a single R Markdown file (.Rmd) with your responses.

1. using functions  
    * Use the `rnorm` function to create a vector called `grades` representing student grades from an Anthropology 101 course with  200 students, mean grade of 68%, and a standard deviation of 10. 

    * Apply a curve of 7% to the class grades in order to raise the mean to to 75%.  Save this to a new variable called `curvedgrades`

    * Make a histogram of `curvedgrades` using the `hist()` function. 
    
2. Organizing data
    * Download [this excel spreadsheet](datasets/bad_data_organization.xls)
    * This spreadsheet is not in a form that can be read into R.  Think about why not, keeping in mind [this information on data input](intro_to_R.html#data-input).
    * Re-organize the excel sheet to make it readable in R, then export it as a text file (or .csv) and read in the data. Make sure that the R markdown file you turn in prints out the dataframe.
    * Describe in words at least two major things that were wrong (from the perspective of an R user) with the original organization of this data file.   

3. Manipulation
    * Read in the file http://hompal-stats.wabarr.com/datasets/gorilla_sizes.txt as a dataframe
    * add a new column called `sex` that that encodes the specimens sex. Hint: you can use the `grep()` function to determine the sex from the specimen number.
