## Problem 1

A.  Load the [Howell's craniometric dataset](http://hompal-stats.wabarr.com/datasets/Howell_craniometry.csv) and get rid of all the columns except for the following: ID, Sex, Population, BNL, MDH, EKB, ZOR, BAA, NBA.
B.  Use the `pairs()` function on just the 6 numeric variables (exclude the ID variable) in order to get a feel for the covariance among the variables. 
C.  Calculate the variance / covariance matrix for the 6 numeric variables.

## Problem 2

A.  Compute a Euclidian distance matrix for the 6 numerical variables.  **Save this to a variable, DO NOT PRINT THIS TO THE SCREEN OR INCLUDE IT IN THE OUTPUT**
B.  Perform a hierarchical cluster analysis using the distance matrix you just computed.
C.  Plot the cluster analysis dendrogram. 

## Problem 3

A.  Perform a discriminant function analysis to see how well the 6 numeric variables predict the Population. Use the `lda()` function in the MASS package. 
B.  Use the `predict()` function to predict how each of the datapoints would be classified. Save the predictions in a variable called `predictions`.  Explore the list of predictions (there is a lot of useful stuff in there!!!)
C.  Extract the predicted population (in the `class` portion of the `predictions` object).  Calculate the proportion of these predictions that are the same as their known population. 
D.  Look at the `x` portion of the `predictions` object.  This contains the actual canononical discriminant scores for each individual.  Make a scatterplot of the first and second discriminant functions.  Color code the points by the actual population.
E.  Was this DFA successful in discriminating groups?  Why or why not?  Explain your answer.
